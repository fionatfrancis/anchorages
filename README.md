data on anchorage use from pilotage database


This is an exploration of anchorage use from pilotage data provided to Lucie Hannah in 2021 from the pilotage association. The data includes the start and end trimes from when a pilot vessel interacted with a shipping tanker. Pilot vessels are necessary to guide the container ships to and from anchorages so provide a good record of anchorage use. The data I am working with has already been slightly modified by L. Hannah to include missing information such as locations that were missing formt the og dataset. I will clarify what else needs to be added when we meet on May 10 2022.


Missing data: We do not have data past Quarter1 from 2021 and we also are missing information on things such as age of This dataset did not include information on anchorage age or depth, added where possible to find these data. 

Positions: Where did this data come from? Some of it is filled in form Selina but the og sheet does not have coordinated but the sorted data does so Lucie must have added these from a file that I do not have? What is the MEIT dataset (Selina wrote notes saying that the names were different in this dataset for some of the anchorages (in file Anchorage_dataset_organised_2021_Jul_21b_SUMMARY_updatedLatLongs_14Jan2021))

Age of anchorages: Who can I contact for this?
